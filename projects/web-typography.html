      <p>So anyways, that figure that I bought? There was a down payment of 160$... THEY TOOK 160$ MONTHS PRIOR TO DELIVERING MY FIGURE TO ME. It is normal to provide a downpayment before the final payment of such a figure, especially when they are beng made as the orders are being placed. I was lucky to even get an order in due to the heavy volume of traffic in most sites that had to option to pre-order the figure itself. Still, it feels weird paying 160$ and not receiving anything for more than half a year. </p>
